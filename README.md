This is a set of components that you can copy and paste into your apps. **Built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**.

No roadmap for now. I'll post this as soon as we have the first component up.

## FAQ

### What do you mean *NOT a component library*?

This means you do not install the components via a package manager. This also means the components are not versioned.

You copy and paste into your project. The code is yours.

### Can I use this for commercial projects?

Yes. The components, utils and everything are free to use for commercial projects. See the [license](https://github.com/shadcn/ui/blob/main/LICENSE)

### Can I contribute components?

Sure. But let me figure out a few things first. You can ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shadcn).
